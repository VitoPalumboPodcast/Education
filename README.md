# Education Mind Map

A lightweight web-based mind map editor for visually organizing your ideas.

## Introduction

This single page application runs entirely in the browser and lets you create nodes, connect them and rearrange the map with different layouts. Data is stored locally so you can pick up your work later without any server.

## Features

- Add, remove and edit nodes with titles, descriptions, tags and icons
- Choose icon color independently from text color
- Connect nodes with directional arrows
- Radial, grid, physics and hierarchical layouts
- Zoom, pan and fit to screen
- Light and dark themes

- Icon/text spacing now scales with icon size to avoid overlap
